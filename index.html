                A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to turn your deviceâ€”whether it's a desktop, smartphone,
                or smartwatchâ€”into an AirTag-like tracker, enabling the attacker to track your location.
                How does it work? Over 1.5 billion iPhones could act as free tracking agents for the attacker worldwide.

                    <p>
                        Imagine someone could turn your laptop, smartphone, or even your gaming console into a tracking
                        device without your knowledge. Our research team discovered a way this can happen through
                        Apple's Find My network - the same system that helps people find their lost iPhones and AirTags.

                        The Find My network uses over a billion Apple devices worldwide. When an AirTag is lost, it
                        sends out Bluetooth signals that nearby iPhones pick up. These iPhones then secretly report the
                        AirTag's location to Apple's cloud, allowing the owner to see where their lost item is.

                        We found a security problem that lets hackers use this system to track almost any device with
                        Bluetooth capabilities - not just Apple products. We call this attack "nRootTag."

                        without
                        having to install expensive tracking equipment in stores. By understanding where people go and
                        how much time they spend in different locations, they can create more targeted advertising
                        campaigns.

                    <p>

                        locations
                        without explicitly asking for GPS permission. They could learn where you shop, what restaurants
                        you visit, and other habits to send you personalized recommendations and ads. This data becomes
                        extremely valuable when combined with your online browsing and purchasing history.

                        individuals, which they then sell to other businesses, political campaigns, or anyone willing to
                        pay.

                        surveillance purposes. They could potentially track specific individuals by getting them to
                        install software containing this tracking code. Unlike traditional tracking methods, this
                        approach wouldn't require physical trackers or direct access to cell tower data.

                        plan more effective device thefts or home break-ins. The method is particularly attractive
                        because it's difficult to detect and doesn't require expensive equipment.

                    <h2 class="title is-3">What Are the Prerequisites?</h2>
                    <p>
                        For someone to track your device using this method, they would need:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>1. Malicious App installed.</b> The attacker needs to get you to run their software on your
                        device. This could happen if you download an app that secretly contains tracking code, or
                        planted by a USB drive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>2. BLE capability.</b> Your device must have Bluetooth hardware, and it must be turned on,
                        which is usually the case. Most modern laptops, phones, and many other gadgets have Bluetooth,
                        and after device activation, the Bluetooth remains turned on by default. Unfortunately, users of
                        Linux, Windows, and Android (versions before 13) cannot prevent Bluetooth from being turned on.
                        This is due to a system feature that allows applications to turn on Bluetooth without user
                        interaction.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>3. Surrounded by FindMy network.</b> There must be Apple devices (iPhones, iPads, etc.)
                        passing near your device occasionally to pick up and relay the tracking signals, regardless on
                        the ground or in the air.

                        Device with Bluetooth Low Energy could be affected, including:
                        Laptops and desktop computers running Windows, Linux, or older versions of macOS;
                        Android smartphones and tablets;

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The attack works in four main steps:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. A piece of malicious software (which we call a "Trojan") runs on your device and gets
                        information about your device's Bluetooth address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. This software connects to a server controlled by the attacker, which performs complex
                        calculations to create a special key that matches your device's Bluetooth identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Your device then starts broadcasting signals that make it look like an AirTag to nearby Apple
                        devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Any iPhones or iPads (participated Find My)that pass nearby will pick up these signals and
                        report the location to
                        Apple's cloud, thinking they're helping someone find a lost AirTag. The attacker can then access
                        these location reports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The attacker doesn't need to be anywhere near you - they can track your location from thousands
                        of miles away as long as there are Apple devices passing near you.

                    <h2 class="title is-3">How Accurate Is the Tracking?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our tests showed that in homes and offices, the tracking can be accurate within 3 meters (about
                        10 feet). Even on a moving e-bike, the system could track location within about 50 meters.

                        We even tested it on an airplane, and while the accuracy was lower (about 70 meters), it was
                        still good enough to reconstruct the entire flight path and identify the flight number.

                        The time it takes to get the first location report is typically between 6-15 minutes, depending
                        on how many Apple devices are nearby.

                    <h2 class="title is-3">How Practical is the Attack?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Without using hypothetical super computers in the future, the attack can be carried out with
                        <b>today's hardware</b>. For a single-use attack, the cost is equivalent to a <b>bottle of soft drink</b>
                        (~$2.2).

                        The cost can be further reduced if the attacker aims at a large number of devices, particularly
                        against Linux systems. Attackers can store every key for Linux in a single hard drive at the
                        cost of $600.

                        The attack is surprisingly time-efficient. Once set up, an attacker can locate a device <b>within
                        minutes</b>.

                        The attack is also stealthy. The attacker can set the tracking signal to appear as MacBooks,
                        which Apple considers "irrelevant" for tracking purposes, <b>avoiding unwanted tracking alerts</b>.

                        In summary, this attack combines affordability, speed, stealth, and scalability, making it a
                        serious privacy concern for users of Linux, Windows, and Android devices with Bluetooth
                        capabilities.

                    <p>
                        However, the attack remains effective as long as there are unpatched iPhones or Apple Watches
                        near the tracked device. Since many people don't update their devices right away, this
                        vulnerability could remain exploitable for some time.

                    <p>
                        To protect yourself from this kind of tracking:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Install apps from trusted source.</b> Be careful about what apps you install, only download
                        apps from trusted sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manage Bluetooth permission.</b> Be cautious about giving Bluetooth permissions to apps that
                        don't obviously need them. When not
                        using Bluetooth, consider revoke applications' Bluetooth permission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Install security patches.</b> Keep your devices updated with the latest security
                        patches, reduce the risk of being attacked by known vulnerabilities. Apple user can also help to
                        protect others by updating their devices and reducing the vulnerable Find My network
                        coverage.
